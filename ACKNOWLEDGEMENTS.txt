Since this code is a fairly straight-out Dart Language translation of the
JavaScript in Material Design Lite, I'm indebted to Google and the contributors
to Material Design Lite.

I peeked at Material Design Lite / Dart <www.material-design-lite.pub> at some
points during development, so thanks also to Mike Mitterer.
